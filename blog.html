				<h4>MITâ€™S INTERCONNECTED EMBEDDED SYSTEM</h4>
				<p>Technology has been in a climb that never stopped, every 18 months its power doubles. We ought to know and keep ourselves updated. As luck would have it, MIT&rsquo;s Interconnected Embedded System workshop was announced open. After, going through different question the application form was finally completed. Out of approx. 120 like us, we got through the application process and buckled up for the journey ahead of us. The workshop kicked off on 27th July 2017 for a six week long journey at Karkhana.<br>
<br>
Workshop was pre-designed by experts, from setting up websites for course resources to managing the desk arrangement in class. The workshop was planned to run for 3-4 hours a day with two days in a week. During the inception of the workshop, we were introduced to our mentors- Mr. Ashim Sitoula and Mr. Prayush Bijukchhe- who later on gave wonderful insight on Internet Of Things (IOT).It was a delightful session which gave us an opportunity to take one of our very first steps on building I.O.T.<br>
<br>
During the first week, we familiarized ourselves with breadboard and connection of the teensy (our main micro-controller) with Organic LED and microphone. We connected Wi-fi module to our system in the following week. The outcome till date was outstanding, by giving a voice input to system, we could display it in text which was decoded with the help of Google API. In our next class, we discussed about the concepts in cryptography and developed python programs to code and decode a message. Moreover, we learnt to use Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) device and connection between client and server. Finally, we learnt to pin point our location with the help of GPS module and parsing algorithm.<br>
<br>
With our workshop nearing its end, we were given an opportunity to showcase our skill and knowledge that we had collected in the past six week. After intense training and guidance, we were now capable of building our own embedded systems. We were ought to build something productive which could make our lives easier. Now, we had to present our project on Karkhana Mela which was scheduled on 23rdSeptember 2017. Both of us worked every hour we could in making an interconnected system that had multiple application. Some salient features of our system were: displaying Weather, GPS, and peer location. We had been burning the candles at both end to get the program debugged.<br>
<br>
Finally, our final code and model was ready. We executed the code and watched it run impeccably, making it a permanent memory in our brain cell. By connecting to the internet through WiFi module, we could display current weather. Not only we could obtain our location but also could share locations to peer. For protection of our system, we even designed our own acrylic casing; made possible through laser cutting technology. During the Mela, we presented our working with attractive big colorful papers reflecting our work. During five hour long fair, we had received many good wishes and praises for our work. Everyone was supportive and filled us with more enticing suggestions. Some of them even recommended us to use VHF and CDMA to improve our system range.<br>
<br>
Overall, the project gave an enriching experience to us and was mesmerized in every way. In addition to learning about the I.O.T system, we also learned valuable life skills such as time management, research and team work. It was one of the most productive time we had ever spent. Not to mention, we also got a chance to meet and be part of an intellectual committee that spends every second of their day building their creative creations focused to make our daily life simpler.<br>

				<h4>Open Street Map</h4>
				<h5><em>OSM and why does it exist?</em></h5><p>
Have you ever wondered about traveling to a new destination without having enough information such as Where to? How far? Which way? Does it even have road leading there? Do I need to cross a river? Unless, you possess an extra-human power, it&rsquo;s next to impossible. If you scroll through travel guides you will not find a page that doesn&rsquo;t mention map. Map is an essential part of our daily life. From thousands of years back till today, we humans have been using maps to navigate. Use and complexity of map has developed over the years. To achieve such quality mappers sketch digital map through a process called mapping. Different approaches exist for mapping, resulting in different types of organization with their own peculiar maps. Out of many, Open Street Map (OSM) is an open data mapping organization. In a community driven with free data, OSM is in the spotlight. Its work in humanitarian sector and precious spinoffs has generated new and advanced mapping world enticing cluster of people toward OSM. The journey embarked by OSM started slow, but hustled its way up and forward.<br>
<br>
Inception<br>
In years before 2004, map data sources were owned or at least controlled by private and governmental players, resulting in an expensive and highly restrictive data sources. Having a detailed map for general purposes like navigation and small research projects at that time was undoable and would still be out of the general public&rsquo;s reach if an open data source for maps such as OSM hadn&rsquo;t been created.<br>
<br>
OSM was founded by Steve Coast, who was an intern at the time he put forward his idea for an open map database. One day, Coast was reading an article about booming Wikipedia -- which is also an open data source &ndash; and was immediately astonished by its growing influences. After pondering about it for a while, he thought to build a system similar to Wikipedia: a free database for maps. Coast had a clear vision about OSM: he foresaw a huge community based platform that helped the community itself by providing them with free data to navigate and build upon.<br>
<br>
But creating database containing billions of data points was not a piece of a cake. At first Coast would cycle around the city of London carrying a GPS dongle and notebook. He started from his local area alone, mapping each street one by one holding firm to his idea every day. The idea of Coast started inducing sparks of interest among his friend circle, and slowly, the circle kept growing. As of today 4.3 million users use and contribute to OSM [2].<br>
<br>
Motivation<br>
However, collecting data and creating maps from scratch is a tedious work. People often opt out after two-three days of mapping. Working out every inch of a map node by node until a perfect map appears is a long task. Nevertheless, out of total 4.3 million active user in 2017, 30% of them have stepped up to contribute in mapping today [3]. I am a mapper too and I spend around four hours a day to map the western part of Nepal. I find myself exploring remote areas, their socio-life, housing and community structures.<br>
<br>
<br>
Learning to map is an adventurous journey. It&rsquo;s not limited to technical skills. Being able to distinguish between types of roads, types of facilities, and mainly being able to visualize town planning/village structures based on nearby resources is intriguing indeed. Mapping is for everyone who is devoted and keen to learn new stuff while residing in his contented residence. This is one out of hundreds of reason people take one-two hours off their busy schedule to map remote areas and fill in additional details to existing database.<br>
<br>
Expansion<br>
In times when OSM was just a sapling, media bolstered the growth by generating awareness and reflecting OSM&rsquo;s potential. This very moment was an auspicious one. With user-friendly map editing environment such as JOSM, a little motivation and Media&rsquo;s full support, updates on map data swelled from about 900 to a little over 6000 weekly in just two years [4], surpassing those of google maps (a big competitor!) whose edits consume more time as they have to be validated by a supervisor every time. With growing media involvement and news about OSM&rsquo;s potential spreading like a wildfire, today OSM tops over 17,000 edits weekly. This reflects the growing community and their passion for open data including its usability.<br>
<br>
OSM is a very versatile open data source. Its uses range from navigation to post disaster relief planning. Features and uses of OSM increases linearly every day. Even now, OSM has thousands of useful features that the users can benefit from. One of the many such features is Streetsweeping.eu which is a wonderful system incorporated using OSM data to alert nearby people or those who use particular roadway on daily basis about sweeping of road going on. From technical overview, Streetsweeping.eu detects your route for any street sweeping going on in current route and uses OSM data and geo location for diversion and alternative route. It is a very simple yet interesting to see its use and how it helped many avoid unnecessary inconvenience. Openwifi.su is another perfect example of advanced use of OSM data. This system structure uses OSM data and overlay that with WLAN positions to pin point geolocation without the need of GPS.<br>
<br>
OSM is now a big community driven organization. With help and constant support from other organizations it is thriving in today&rsquo;s competitive tech world. Imperial College London, UK and University College London provides OSM with their core structure- data center and bandwidth [5]. Quova developed by a California based company Neustar IP Intelligence, provide OSM with real-time GPS location of user. These and many other companies provide OSM with similar foundational support to run the organization as smoothly as possible. Furthermore, eCourier is another company based in UK provided OSM with their GPS waypoint data which helped mapper to craft even more accurate map database.<br>
<br>
With constant support and acknowledgement from different companies, OSM today provide users with navigation, layer filtering features, calculating routes and to decide on &not;&not;best restaurants for your first date based on reviews [6]. The map data is available in smartphones making it more accessible extending its reach even further. The extent of its development has a wide spectrum with many more corners to be discovered.<br>
<br>
Impacts<br>
OSM has been in the table for more than 14 years now. Its journey has been extraordinary. OSM has brought many changes in mindsets of people and ways people approach digital mapping. The level of mapping in OSM is layered evenly with beginner, intermediate and professional ranks. Even beginners can start mapping on their first day of tutorial. Its user-friendly editor makes it much easier for new ones to learn quickly. From a young one looking for an opportunity to quickly grab technical skills to an elderly person wanting to contribute for greater cause, OSM is a perfect choice.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, OSM brings people closer: it helps build a separate community of mappers. For example, in Nepal, programs such as DIAL (Digital Internship and Leadership) brings youths together by organizing events where they collectively map remote areas of Nepal and share their experiences with each other. This particular event not only provide youths with technical mapping skills but also feed them with communication and leadership skills. DIAL is just one of the many examples, there are hundreds of programs out there that focus in youths&rsquo; overall development.<br>
<br>
Describing OSM&rsquo;s myriad of uses in this single paper is undoable. But leaving out Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), a major branch of OSM, is simply unjustifiable. HOT is an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through openstreetmap. It works together to provide map data which revolutionizes disaster management, reduces risks, and contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. HOT is spread across the whole world with volunteers, community leaders and professionals committed to work for the welfare of our society.<br>
<br>
OSM in Nepal<br>
As we discussed previously, OSM is stretched everywhere. From navigating villages in South Africa to planning a route to climb the glorious Mt. Everest, OSM has you covered. And it shouldn&rsquo;t be of much surprise to you when you find out that OSM also works in Nepal. In fact, OSM has had major roles in either disaster management or connecting highly remote areas of Nepal.<br>
<br>
Organizations like Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), Mapbox, OSM Nepal and galli galli have undertaken and acknowledged the mission of OSM. They are working in mapping remote areas and creating awesome applications based on OSM data for local use. For example, Jaibik Map, a project of KLL and other collaborators, helps map locations of different mammals taking shelter in Nepal. It even graphically represents useful information regarding the mammals. Similarly, Sajha Sabha (another project of KLL) helps connect local people and governmental officials using OSM data to graphically map governmental projects and their details.<br>
<br>
In addition, OSM has also played major roles in disaster management programs. For instance, on April, 2015 a 7.8Mw earthquake struck Nepal with consecutive hundreds of major aftershocks. Chaos filled every street and city of Nepal. Minutes later earthquake, relief materials and aids form all around the world started to add in. OSM played an extraordinary role. HOT, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team responded minutes after the earthquake by creating task to map affected areas [7]. It was realized that not all parts of earthquake struck areas were mapped. In only 48hrs after the earthquake, 2000 mappers started mapping from HOT task manager. The distribution channel was all based on OSM data which included routes to affected villages, open grounds or community built houses for shelter, and guiding rescuers with geolocation data. Similarly, in 2010, Haiti was struck with a major 7.0 Mw earthquake affecting thousands and death toll skyrocketing every hour. OSM&rsquo;s community mapped Haiti to its last corner. With this help, damage assessment teams could be deployed more efficiently, which was a major turning point for OSM. Its potential in the field of disaster preparedness and management was visually demonstrated to the world. This enticed more non-profit organizations and companies to participate in the movement of making data open for all. The result of mass involvement gave rise to other saplings, or spinoffs, of OSM. Its capacity is still not to be challenged.<br>
<br>
Spinoffs<br>
OSM based application can go up to (and probably even beyond) thousands if we start counting. Peculiar applications worth sharing are: F4 map, CycleStreets and Prepare Pokhara by KLL. These application may or may not cover the total potential of OSM but will give a general idea of its Spinoffs.<br>
<br>
F4 map is a company that visualizes 2d data into 3d data for business and general public use. It is also based on data from OSM: the 2d data provided by OSM is rendered in 3d structures using all primary, secondary and tertiary data of a building or facilities. It contextualizes and highlights information presenting it aesthetically, making it easier for architects, mappers, planners and engineers to plan their next venture. The user-interface is also simple and interactive which expands the eligibility of users. Similarly, CycleStreets is another application based on OSM. It helps generate routing options for cycle users. Its layered application provides more features for cyclist like trail grades, city routes, pit stops, and repair stores with many more being added every day, making cycling more efficient and safer. Sajha sabha, jaibik map and HOT which was discussed before is also a perfect example to showcase the potential of OSM and its impact in our everyday life.<br>
<br>
Personally speaking, if you ask me for my introduction I can promise you that I will include &ldquo;I am a Mapper, and I support Open Data&rdquo;. Being a contributor of Open Data makes me proud. Helping hundreds of people suffering from disasters, civil wars, and abuses remotely is no less that a dream job. For the past three weeks, I have been mapping the western part of Nepal with addition to research about OSM unruffled. During that time, I noticed some additional improvements that could be implemented to expand the reach of OSM.<br>
<br>
Speaking of improvements, one feature that could be introduced to OSM is Digital Underground mapping. It has been around for a long time, but making it an open source has not been done yet. Map data of surface only could not be enough. For instance, if you are to plan a construction of an underground subway, you need data about its soil, already existing infrastructures and local resources/mines. These data are privatized and cost huge amount to use. Therefore, if we drive our community in building map data for underground structures we could foster thousand more development projects. The data can also be used for safety purposes. For example, Pokhara (a major tourist attraction place) is sitting upon a ground that has caves or hollow structures beneath the ground due to the erosion caused by flowing water. Many cases of surface collapsing have also been reported on yearly basis. If we had underground data about the actual structure of hollow structures, we could prevent future losses of infrastructures and human life. Similarly, construction of new infrastructures can cross-check underground maps for better foundation and loadbearing calculations. If underground map data can be brought to the individual-level of surface maps, it could bring about huge changes in the ways we plan towns and infrastructure constructions.<br>
<br>
However, mapping underground comes with its own technical challenges and its feasibility. I am no expert in this field, but after an in-depth research on the internet, I found out that electromagnetic pulses can be used for underground mapping. The pulse is sent through a hand held device and depending upon the material submerged underground, those pulses reflect with varying intensity and time-differences (phase difference). These data can be processed to create different cross-section ranging from 3 to 50 meter depth depending upon the source of pulse. With the help of a software that renders pulse data, producing a readable map is not that big of a deal. For underwater mapping, robotic submarine type vessel fitted with sonar technology can be used to discover 139.7 square miles of land filled with abundant of new discoveries.<br>
<br>
Future prospect<br>
Fitted with advanced technologies and millions of enthusiastic members, we can expect OSM to start mapping other planets. Funny it may sound, but as William Shakespeare says, &ldquo;It is not in the starts to hold our destiny but in ourselves.&rdquo; Our future depends on how we react to a problem and craft solutions to it. Similarly, the future of OSM also depends on the community itself. We need to continue contributing to our database, influence more people, and finally, make the community even stronger. For this purpose, OSM foundation hosts State of the Map conference annually where mappers, thinkers and developers come together to learn and share their experience they cumulated in a year&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s a great way to stay up-to-date about the ongoing projects and its result.<br>
<br>
OSM has multiple platforms to foster in. From the use of map data in smartphones to car, OSM has held tight to its presence. OSM has more database info about primary, secondary, and tertiary data levels of an infrastructure than that of its competitors. The quality and extent of data available can easily challenge bigger companies like google maps. Map data being free is a tie-breaker for OSM. Websites nowadays use OSM data, car companies such as BMW use OSM data, agriculture sectors use OSM data [8]. The growth of OSM vs time will always have a positive gradient. OSM has capacity to work with more advanced technologies in the future. The data stored can be used in different sectors of science. Thus, with rapidly accelerating technology, OSM can keep up and will bring great aid in developing technology that affects social-life.<br>
